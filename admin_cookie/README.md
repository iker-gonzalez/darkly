# Admin MD5 Cookie Encryption Vulnerability

## Overview

This document outlines a security vulnerability involving the manipulation of a cookie encrypted with the MD5 hashing algorithm. The vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a specific behavior in the web application by altering the value of a cookie.

## Vulnerability Description

The application sets a cookie with a value that is an MD5 hash. Initially, this cookie's value represents the string "false", encrypted using MD5. The vulnerability arises because the application performs actions based on the decrypted value of this cookie without proper validation or integrity checks.

## Exploitation

To exploit this vulnerability, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Cookie**: Locate the cookie in your browser's developer tools. This cookie is set by the application and contains an MD5 hash of the string "false".

2. **Modify the Cookie**: Use an MD5 hash generator to encrypt the string "true". Replace the original cookie value with this new MD5 hash.

3. **Trigger the Vulnerable Behavior**: Refresh or navigate within the application. If the exploitation is successful, the application will execute a specific action, such as displaying an alert with a flag, indicating that the altered cookie value has been accepted and processed.

## Prevention and Mitigation

- **Use Stronger Hashing Algorithms**: Replace MD5 with more secure hashing algorithms that are resistant to collisions, such as SHA-256.

- **Implement Integrity Checks**: Ensure that the application verifies the integrity of cookie values before processing them. This can be achieved through the use of HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) or other mechanisms that validate the data's origin and integrity.

- **Secure Cookie Handling**: Mark cookies as HttpOnly and Secure to prevent them from being accessed through client-side scripts or intercepted over non-HTTPS connections.

- **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and mitigate potential security issues related to cookie handling and other aspects of the application.
